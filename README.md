# üöÄPortfolio Optimization and Market Performance Analysis using Python and MLüìä


## üìå Project Overview
Financial markets are highly dynamic, influenced by volatility, macroeconomic trends, and sector rotations. Traditional portfolio allocation approaches often rely on market-cap weighting or sector diversification, which may not capture the optimal risk-return trade-off.

This project leverages **Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and DBSCAN** to segment stocks based on **return-volatility** profiles. The goal is to construct **risk-adjusted portfolios** that outperform traditional benchmarks such as the **S&P 500** and the **Magnificent 7**. The strategy also incorporates **Sentiment Analysis using the News API** to gauge market sentiment and adjust portfolio selection accordingly. The strategy is then rigorously **backtested** and evaluated across multiple market conditions (2021-2025).

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Live stock data** from the **S&P 500** was retrieved from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).
- **Returns, volatility, beta, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown, and Value-at-Risk (VaR)** were computed for each stock.
- **Sentiment Analysis using News API**: Extracted market sentiment scores from financial news to enhance portfolio selection.
- **Data cleaning**: Missing values were removed, and tickers were adjusted to ensure compatibility with Yahoo Finance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- **Daily Returns & Volatility**: Computed using rolling window standard deviations.
- **Beta Calculation**: Stocks were compared to the **S&P 500** benchmark.
- **Sharpe & Sortino Ratios**: Used to measure risk-adjusted returns.
- **Max Drawdown**: Identified worst-case declines in portfolio value.
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR) & Conditional VaR (CVaR)**: Estimated potential losses under extreme market conditions.
- **Sentiment Scores from News**: Incorporated into stock selection to adjust portfolio weighting based on positive or negative market sentiment.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering for Stock Selection
- **Hierarchical Clustering** was used to segment stocks based on return-volatility profiles.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and DBSCAN** were applied for robustness in clustering.
- **Dendrogram Analysis** determined the optimal number of clusters.
- **Stocks were selected across multiple clusters** to maximize diversification.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Optimization
- **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)** was applied to determine optimal portfolio weights.
- Single-cluster and **multi-cluster portfolio** selections were tested.
- The **Top 100 stocks** based on Sharpe Ratio and sentiment analysis were chosen for final allocation.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Backtesting & Performance Analysis
- **Portfolio returns** were compared to the **S&P 500** and **Magnificent 7**.
- **Investment Growth Analysis**: How $100,000 would grow under each strategy.
- **Rolling Volatility & Maximum Drawdown**: Risk assessments over time.
- **Sector Allocation Analysis**: Portfolio diversity measured using GICS classifications.
- **Performance Comparison for 2022 & 2023**: Evaluating results under bear and bull markets.
